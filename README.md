# Spam Mail Classification

<p>Spam email classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) is a process that automates the detection and filtering of unwanted or malicious emails. The task involves analyzing email content, metadata, and user interaction patterns to distinguish between spam (unwanted) and ham (legitimate) emails. NLP techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming help preprocess email text, while ML algorithms such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM) models are trained on labeled datasets to identify patterns and classify emails. Key features, including email structure are extracted to improve classification accuracy. Once trained, these models can classify incoming emails in real-time, continuously learning from new data and user feedback.</p>

# Detailed Explanation about the project 

<p>Spam email classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) is the process of automatically identifying and filtering out unwanted or harmful emails (spam) from legitimate emails (ham) based on their content and other features. This project involves several steps foe implementing the project model :</p>
<p><b>Text Preprocessing:</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Tokenization:</b>Splitting the email content into words or phrases.</p>
<p><b>(ii) Stopword Removal: </b>Eliminating common words (e.g., "the", "is") that don't contribute much meaning.</p>
<p><b>(iii) Stemming/Lemmatization</b>Reducing words to their root forms (e.g., "running" to "run").</p>
<p><b>(iv) Feature Extraction: </b>Converting the text into numerical representations, such as Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).</p>
<p><b>Model Training:</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Supervised Learning:</b>Common algorithms include Naive Bayes, Random Forest , Support Vector Machines (SVM). These are trained on a labeled dataset (spam vs. ham emails).</p>
<p><b>(ii) Text Classification: </b>The model learns patterns and relationships in the data, distinguishing between spam and ham based on the features extracted.</p>
<p><b>Model Evaluation:</b></p>
<p>The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Precision and recall are particularly important in spam classification to minimize both false positives (ham emails marked as spam) and false negatives (spam emails missed by the filter).</p>
<p><b>Deployment & Continuous Learning:</b></p>
<p>Once deployed, the system continuously classifies incoming emails. Some advanced models might also learn from user feedback (e.g., marking an email as spam) to improve over time.</p>

# Brief Expalanation about the code 

<p>The very first thing is that I have used Jupyter Notebook for importing the python libraries like pandas and numpy , next inseerted the dataset which need to be trained to the ML model and started training the model using NLP with a related library known as Scikit-Learn and thn I have used ML and implemented the Naive Bayes algorithm for this model and after completion of training the model . The next step I have taken is to test the model and verify it as per my imagined results. Then I achieved a highest accuracy of 97% with a excellent precision.The last thing, I have done is deploying the model in the local system with the streamlit cloud software and achieved the output successfully.
